# Data-Analytics-Portfolio
Hi! I am Ramana. I have a Bachelors in Engineering (ECE) and a Masters in Psychology. I have been freelancing as a writer for the last few years. Currently, I am looking to transition back into IT as a Data Analyst. 

In this portfolio, I have included and will be adding a variety of my data analysis projects which showcase my skills and understanding in Python, MS Excel, SQL, Statistics and Tableau. I have solid understanding of data cleaning, preparation, merging, analysis, interpretation and dashboarding. I hope you find my portfolio to be informative and engaging, and I welcome any opportunity to discuss my qualifications further with you.

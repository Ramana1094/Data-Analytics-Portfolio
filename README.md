 # Data Analytics Portfolio - Ramana Bansal

Hello World! I am Ramana. I have Bachelors in Engineering (ECE) and a Masters in Psychology. For certain reasons, I have been freelancing as a tutor and a writer for the last few years. Currently, I am looking to transition back into IT as a Data Analyst. In order to do so, I have been upskilling myself in Python (pandas, matplotlib), MS Excel, SQL, Tableau and Statistics. I have also been applying my learnings into data projects so as to further my understanding and proficiency.

In this portfolio, I have included and will be adding a variety of my data analysis projects which showcase my skills and understanding in Python, MS Excel, SQL, Statistics and Tableau. Through these projects, I have developed a solid understanding of data cleaning, preparation, merging, statistical analysis, interpretation and visualization. I hope you find my portfolio to be informative and engaging, and I welcome any opportunity to discuss my qualifications further with you. 

You can find my CV [here]().
